Testing and Collaboration Using Git&Github and JUnit

Repository Name: JUnit

Description
This repository demonstrates how testing works using JUnit. It contains two primary files:
- `Calculator.java`: A class that includes various methods for mathematical operations.
- `CalcTest.java`: A class that tests these methods using JUnit.

Features
- A set of mathematical operations implemented in `Calculator.java`.
- Extensive testing of these operations using JUnit in `CalcTest.java`.
- Collaboration and contribution through GitHub's fork and pull request model.

Methods
The `Calculator.java` class includes the following methods:
- `add(int a, int b)`: Adds two integers.
- `subtract(int a, int b)`: Subtracts the second integer from the first.
- `multiply(int a, int b)`: Multiplies two integers.
- `divide(double a, double b)`: Divides the first integer by the second.
- `factorial(int n)`: Calculates the factorial of an integer.
- `sqrt(double a)`: Calculates the square root of a double using a custom algorithm.
- `power(double base, int exponent)`: Raises a base to an exponent.
- `gcd(int a, int b)`: Finds the greatest common divisor of two integers.
- `maxArray(int[] arr)`: Finds the maximum value in an array of integers.
- `sumArray(int[] arr)`: Calculates the sum of an array of integers.
- `averageArray(int[] arr)`: Calculates the average of an array of doubles.
- `medianArray(int[] arr)`: Finds the median value in an array of integers.
- `isPrime(int n)`: Checks if an integer is a prime number.
